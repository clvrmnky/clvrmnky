## Greetings, Earthlings 🖖

- 🔭 Currently exploring how to fine-tune models, orchestrating AI with parallelism
- 👹 I'm currently learning Japanese. 
- Species: 👽
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a UX Designer transitioning into a Desgin Techonlogist. Innovating product design as a discpline through AI orchestration. And no, not talking about Figma Make or Loveable. 

Stuff I've Designed & built in the last year 2025/2026: 
- An agent that creates entire design system from the ground up. Creates variables, tokens, and json that can be uploaded into figma. Then provides step by step scaffolding for creating figma components. 
- I built a context-knowledge base that scrapes claude code conversations and persists context for current/future sessions. 
- TextFrames - A new UI/Design Artifact for testing/iterating interfaces specifically for LLMs 
- Trained a Transformer Model 150k Tokens w/ 3M Params. This was just to learn the workflow. Now moving into fine-tuning. 
- Multiple local applications from the ground up pair-programmed w/ Claude Code.
- next up I'm going to write my own version of World's Biggest Pacman and run on a Raspberry Pi. The Co-op mode is great fun for me and the Wife lady. :)
